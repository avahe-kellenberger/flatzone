# Win Conditions
- Being able to keep a stock or percent lead helps out a ton. She has a hard time approaching and you can play more defensively.
- Holding control of center stage helps tremendously since her kill power is reduced and she has to commit if you're shielding.
- Capitalizing off of any combo starter but not overcommitting. She has a frame 1 air dodge and a counter so be careful of combos that aren't true.

# Focus
- Side B habits and mixups. If you have a good grasp on how she will approach you can punish most attacks.
- Interactions with shield. She has no good kill throws aside from fthrow at high percents (and usually works on ledge only)
- Approaches in general. A good read on them will let you rack up damage easily as well as kill. You can upsmash grounded side b OoS to kill. 

# Neutral
- Shield a lot. When she rushes in its usually a grab. Spot dodge and smash attack or upb. 
- Side B on shield can be upsmashed or upb'd. Grab at low percents.
- Dash attack crosses up. UpB works if close enough or just bair OoS if too far.
- Try to bait out smash attacks or side b. 

# Disadvantage

## Ledge
- Will probably go for smash attacks. Maybe bair to bait out rolls or jumps. Best to recover really high if possible.
- Can't wait too long or I'll get down smashed or down tilted.
- Roll is the most punishable so don't roll too much. 
- Well timed regular getups should lead to punishes when shielding afterwards. Careful of grabs though.
- Dash attack crosses up on shield which is usually followed up by a side b towards the stage as a mixup.

## Juggling
- Don't dair when shes on the ground or if at high percents. Go offstage or mix up landings. 
- Directional air dodging is really bad. 
- SDI down or down/away lets you get out of her combos pretty easily. Followups are limited though dair will kill at high percents.
- SDI up may let you up B but you can die if she follows it. 
- SDI aerial side b away? Needs more testing.

# Advantage

## Ledge
- Try to call out side b from ledge. Don't stand at ledge too much. Upsmash and nair are good attacks to punish a whiffed side b.
- Chef works pretty well on ledge. Don't overuse or she will witch time it. 
- She doesn't always snap to ledge so dsmash and ftilt can hit her easily with good timing. She can punish a whiff with side b though.
- Look out for wall clings she can change her timings up. A dair can deter this. 

## Offstage
- When offstage you can bair her pretty easily but it has to be spaced correctly so it won't trade with side b. 
- Dair is very useful. Beats out almost anything unless you misspace it when she up b's. 
- She has a very good recovery in terms of distance so she can go pretty low or high too. 

## Juggling
- Usually cant get more than a nair>upair or nair>nair or uair>uair. Don't overcommit to a juggle since she has a good air dodge. 
- Mix up your juggling with empty hops. Chances are she'll throw out a witch time or an airdodge which can lead to a heavier punish. 

# Misc.
- Upsmash OoS her side B
- Fsmash or Dsmash her smash attacks on shield. Especially when using guns after a smash attack. It can reach when you're out of stun range. 
- Nothing to bucket aside from charged bullets. Better than airdodging but don't miss if you're off stage. Bullets aren't very useful on stage.
- The longer she is in the air using specials the more landing lag she has. Try to capitalize on this.
- First witch time is the strongest then it stales after each use until she dies. Length of it depends on how well it is timed. 
- Dthrow 9 does't work since she has a frame 1 air dodge.

# Stages

## Battlefield
- Combo extensions are invaluable on this stage.
- You can live longer and it's much harder for her to land. 
- Stage control is much easier to keep on this stage. 
- High blast zone so she can't kill you as early with a combo and more time to get out of it.

## Final Destination
- Neutral stage. Neither character gets much. 

## Town and City
- Platform extensions do too much damage or kill
- Blastzones are close to ledge so I die earlier. 
- I don't get much off platforms on this stage.
- Large stage makes it easier for her to camp.

## Smashville
- Harder for her to side b
- Safe from dair under the platform. 
- Harder for her to aerial when under the platform. 

## Pokemon Stadium 2
- Decent stage but it's large and gives her space to run. 
- Ledges are close to blast zones so she kills earlier there. 
- Stage control is key here as well though she can use the platforms for mixups.

## Yoshi's Story
- Both characters benefit on this stage. Though you can kill her much earlier than she can kill you if you stay grounded and hold center stage.
- Avoid platforms since they can get you killed if she combos you off them.
- Catch landings with up air or nair. 

## Lylat
- Side B is really good. 
- Harder to land because of platforms. 
- Harder to land with aerials overall. 

## Kalos
- You get to live very long and she has more distance to cover for her combos.
- She can camp you out since it's a large stage so try to keep a lead.
- Her kill options are all less effective.
