## General gameplan

- Generally what I do is use nair a lot until about 30 percent, then I spam the ever loving fuck outta bomb

- Be careful of egg toss when edge guarding

- You can try to bait a high recovery by jumping out early backwards and threatening a back air which if they jump you can return to stage and punish the landing. Back air will go through egg so if they throw it out you can hit through or drop beneath it and punish the end lag. Up air is really good at covering going above ledge as well. If they don't jump you can drop down and hit them with the back air.

- If you don't have time to do this though, your best bet is to ledgetrap. Using bacon is tough, because of egg toss. So, I usually wait until they grab ledge, and reflect/shield any eggs, then ledge trap normally.
