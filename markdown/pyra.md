## General gameplan and tips

Pythra’s disjoints beat G&W pretty hard, but Aegis has a pretty bad disadvantage state, particularly landing and recovering. 
If you can gimp Aegis, you win.

In neutral camp Pyra out. If she gets to hit you you lose. 

Focus on their habits when they recover, it’s a bit linear but they can mix it up with swap.
Luckily, bair is long lasting enough to last through swap.

If you put them in a situation where they have to Photon Edge to recover, you can use up b to send them further off stage.
See [this video timestamp](https://youtu.be/MWSPUz2iMSI?t=1277) of Miya using up b against Mythra's side b.

They are a bait and punish character (especially Mythra, Pyra is more of a Waller) too but Mythra significantly outspeeds G&W so you can’t really camp her out. Remember the neutral triangle (Bait and punish beats poking, overshooting beats B&P, poking beats overshooting). Keep Aegis in disadvantage for as long as possible, juggling and ledgetrapping them to hell. Pyra F Tilt is safe on G&W shield if spaced properly so don’t contest that. If Pyra is above you on a platform, beware of her dair.

When landing, stay the hell away from them. 

The key in neutral is seriously just better bait and punish, overshooting and poking. Don’t grab movement, only grab whiffs (that’s universal but it’s especially true with Mythra. However, it’s a bit weird. Foresight activation frames lasts from frames 2-7, but grabs don’t activate Foresight, so she can be grabbed until Frame 8).
