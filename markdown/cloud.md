## General gameplan and tips

Our best opening we have vs Cloud is when he’s off stage.
Try getting him off stage, then killing him with bair.
If he’s recovering low, we can dash attack 2 frame his up B almost always (even with limit up b).

Play grounded, he can swat us out of the air very easily with huge hitboxes without thinking

Make use of dash -> shield and walk -> shield to mess up his spacing, to give us openings to use up b oos

Parry his fair/bair, then dash attack or grab

If he’s constantly using falling aerials, we can open him up with a pre-emptive up b, or fh nair

## Getting out of the corner

- If we’re being pressured in the corner, don’t jump
- Walk -> shield is really good here
- Getting grabbed by cloud never matters, so don't worry about that here
- You can also up b through his shit in the corner because of our iframes, then just have to deal with landing

## Ledge trapping

Chef at ledge is really good as it can force a jump from ledge. You can call out the jump with sh up air, which combos into up b, sending cloud back off stage.

Cloud’s up smash is huge, he can punish spaced landing bair on shield with up smash

Cloud Neutral b can be absorbed by bucket, and bucket will kill at around 15%.

## Cloud up b counterplay

- Shield the rising hits, roll behind him, and charge down smash
- Shield the rising hits, spot dodge the falling hits, and down smash
- Shield rising hits, up b or up air him on the way down
- Shield rising hits, up smash him on the way down

## Cloud side b counterplay:

If Cloud does a full side b on our shield, it’s -24. We have just enough time to drop shield -> dsmash

If Cloud starts side b on our shield, we can roll behind him after the 2nd hit

Cloud’s limit side B can be parried easily for a free down smash

Watch [this video on how to spot dodge cloud side b](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXROMJgX9J0), it’s really free
