## General gameplan

- While getting hit by powerdunk, SDI’ing down+in really hard will make you fall out of the move, pretty much 100% of the time

- Power Gyser is -29 on shield. Either up smash, or dsmash this move

- Buster wolf is -45 on shield. You can charge an up smash for quite a long time here for a huge punish

- His neutral b can be absorbed with bucket, and his approach options aren’t great. Force him to approach, and call out his movement.
Bucket will kill at 15% at center stage on FD.
 
- Once Terry gets go meter, you should be careful when attacking his shield with anything but nair or fair as he can do jab into buster wolf if you do a laggy move on his shield which can kill at around 60-70%.

- Terry can do Jab Jab Input Up B and it will kill G&W at around 100%
This can be avoided by sdi away, however you have to guess if Terry is doing Input up b or input down b, so when you go over 100% it’s easier to just try to avoid any committal moves on his shield.

- Crack Shoot has 12 frames of endlag on shield, which means a perfectly timed down smash can punish crack shoot OOS. You can also punish with up b.
Some Terry players love to do Crack Shoot in the middle of neutral. This can be intercepted mid Crack Shoot by Up smash or F smash, however you have to read it and time it correctly.

## Edge guarding

- Terry players seem to love recovering high, with either burning knuckle or powerdunk.
This predictable recovery makes them very susceptible to our Bair or Up b

- If terry recovers low, we can easily stage-spike with bair since their mixups off stage are very limited

## Bread and Butter kill confirm percents

- Nair -> Dtilt will kill terry at around 104% at ledge
- Nair -> Ftilt kills at around 115% at ledge
