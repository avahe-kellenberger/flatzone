## General gameplan

- Jigglypuff players like to play passive and campy this can be punished by fair spamming and up air spamming if they try to go over you

- Jigglypuff can’t really beat G&W’s disjoints, so you should abuse fair and bair as much as possible

- A lot of Jigglypuff players like to use pound to approach to counter this. Make sure to keep your distance from puff and don’t just jump straight into puff.

- Pound can be beaten by bair and fsmash. If you expect Puff to pound, dash back -> fsmash is a good minimal risk punish that can kill puff at 70%

- Pound also combo’s into soft fair into rest, so avoiding getting hit by pound at 26-40% is top priority
Furthermore, pound -> soft fair -> rest can be avoided by di’ing away on the pound

- Doing a random upsmash when a puff approaches is a good mixup, and can catch a stray puff aerial
G&W is such a cheater character that it’s almost impossible for a puff to punish you for doing a random upsmash
 
## Dealing with puff offstage, dair loops, and recovering

- Jigglypuff is one of the few characters in the game where G&W can struggle to edgeguard or even ledgetrap.
If Jigglypuff recovers low, using dair off stage can be a good punish, or just waiting for her to come to stage and ledgetrapping with chef can also be good

- If Jigglypuff recovers high, there’s nothing G&W can really do to stop her so just wait on stage and harass her with up airs when she tries coming back down

- You can escape jigglypuff dair loops by hard sdi'ing up

- Jigglypuff has a confirm of dair into rest, so make sure to switch up which way your sdi'ing up as to not get hit by rest

- If a Jigglypuff misses rest, use a charged upsmash to kill at 50% or later

- Jigglypuff is also one of the few characters that can actually punish G&W up b.
If she uses pound at ledge, it will 2 frame G&W up b every time. To counter this, use bucket to slow your fall to try and mix up when you're going to up b, so the puff will mess up the timing

## Bread and Butter kill confirm percents

- Nair -> Ftilt will kill puff at 88% at ledge.

- Nair -> Dtilt will kill puff at 80% at ledge (Note nair -> Dtilt is very inconsistent against short character’s like puff).
