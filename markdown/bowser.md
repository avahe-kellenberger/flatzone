## General gameplan

- In neutral, Bowser will try to fight you in neutral with patience, good positioning and using up B oos as a zone bursting option. He will spend his time in neutral playing grounded bc he has access to quick grounded buttons like jab and ftilt. 

- He has very little ways to directly contest sh ff nair besides these options. 

- Bowser up B oos is a good zone disrupting tool and can be annoying if we mispace an aerial on his shield. But, he is open for a huge punish afterwards. At low percents we can get dash grab, nair or usmash as a combo starter and at higher percents we can get usmash/dsmash oos. 

- Bowserâ€™s disadvantage is horrible. Harass him as hard as you can with up air and try to push him to the corner for a ledgetrap/edgeguard. 

- Be weary of Bowser dair if you are at high percents, but this option loses to our up air.

- Ledgetrap Bowser _outside_ of roll distance. His getup attack is huge, and can catch poorly spaced chef setups.  

- You can bait him to getup attack by purposefully doing mispaced chef into dtilt oos. But, look out for dropdown side B. 

- Most bowsers will be looking for ledgejump nair into bair kill confirm as their escape option. Catch their jumps with nair or up air and keep the pressure going.

- When bowser is offstage, he has decent mixups if he has his double jump. Use up B as an edgeguarding option to push him offstage if you have to. 

## Disadvantage

- Disadvantage vs Bowser is tough, because of his ground speed. Retreat to the corner and avoid landing on spots where he can catch your landing with utilt or usmash. 

- He can use flame breath to catch your landings, but this works if he knows you like to land aggressively! 

- Getting off ledge vs Bowser is tough because he can react to every option besides jump with up B oos. Getting off the ledge with jump is your best option, then you slowly mix in other escape options. 

- When recovering, please do not overshoot up B as a recovery. He will punish you on the way down with usmash, utilt or up air. 

- When you are at KO percents, look out for Bowser side B. He will catch you with this when he knows you are scared and become shield heavy.

## Bread and Butter kill confirm percents
