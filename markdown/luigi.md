# Win Conditions
- Bait out grab
- Consistent edgeguards
- Juggling for damage
- Get offstage as much as possible
- Force to approach

# Focus
- Up Smash OoS/Up B OoS habits
- Recovery habits
- Grab Habits
- Watch my percents for grab confirms
- Down b to break combos. Bait and punish it.

# Neutral
- Keep away from him to try to bait out grab
- Platform camp to rack up damage past around 30
- Camp out at 0 to avoid 0-death
- Use anything to get him offstage

# Disadvantage:

## Ledge
- Watch out for zair>dair.
- will throw out active hit boxes to cover ledge options.
- Can't punish waiting effectivley except with zair. 
- If dtilting or dash attacking ledge then drop down nair will work very well. 
- Don't roll because of grabs, up b, dash attack, etc.
- Regular getup through zair then up b could work well.

## Juggling
- Can keep you in the air with nair, upair, down b.
- Don't dair at high percents because of down b invincibility. 
- Best to go offstage to recover. 
- SDI and DI away to get out of combos.

# Advantage

## Ledge
- Bacon works very well against him.
- Dash attack works well to keep him offstage and 2 frame up b. 
- Dair can spike him with a 2frame. 
- Ledgetrump nair or dair.

## Offstage
- Bair works very well. Beats out his side b, just watch out for misfires. 
- Drag down nair and bair can get him low enough to force an option or to kill.
- Dair if you have a jump and are high enough if needed. 
- If you misread an option go back to ledge to get jump back and go for more bairs. 
- If he gets above you use up-b to get him further offstage.
- Nair and bair and dair to deal with low recoveries. 

## Juggling
- Bad disadvantage in the air. Abuse it with nair, upair, bair, up-b.
- Doesn't have many options aside from airdodging to get out of juggles.
- Catch landings with dash attack or bair. 
- Airdodge is laggy and his best option so bait it out and nair it or bair it. 
- Avoid getting too close because of down b. If he's fast falling then nair and if he's at a distance then up air.

# Misc.
- They're going to mash down b out of hitstun. Frame 1 invinicibilty.
- Watch out for zair, fireball, grab mixups. 
- Don't touch his shield at all.
- Grab is pretty slow so he can't punish OoS at a distance too well. 

# Stages:

## Battlefield
- Good for camping plats.
- Big blast zones. 

## Final Destination: 
- Always ban. 

## Town and City
- Always ban.

## Smashville:
- Good stage overall. Camp under the platform with chef when at an advantage.
- Good platform to camp at 0%.
- Platform makes it harder for him to land. Easier to punish up-b. 

## Pokemon Stadium 2: 
- Pretty neutral. Okay to start here but wouldn't go back. Big blast zones help him more than they help me. 

## Yoshi's Story: 
- Can be okay for both sides. Both die earlier.
- Avoid it in general though because of down b, nair, and upair killing earlier.

## Lylat:
- Avoid heavily.
- Hard to break zone of aerials and grabs and zairs due to low platforms. Very hard to land and take stage control. 
- Can gimp him so he probably won't take you there but always keep in mind.
- Ledges close to blastzones. Somewhat low ceiling.

## Kalos:
- Platforms good for edgeguarding.
- Can dair if he's close to the stage while offstage.
- Higher ceiling so down b and up b won't kill as early.
